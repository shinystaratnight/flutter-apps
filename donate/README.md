## Purpose:
We are developing a charity mobile application which will be available to use internationally by donors and nonprofit organizations, 
so that people who are in financial needs can get monetary assistance.

The scope of the project will also include the admin panel, which is responsible to manage the app. 

## Installation:
-Flutter & Dart 
We used flutter version 2.5.1 and Dart version 2.14.1 as a programming language and framework to develop the app. 
To install the correct version of Flutter and Dart, use the following link download Flutter and Dart as one package: 
https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases

-Android Studio
The app was developed in the latest version of Android Studio, other similar IDE's work as well. Upon the installation of Android Studio
(Install at https://developer.android.com/studio), you will need to configure the emulator via the AVD manager settings in Android Studio. 
The emulator API version is API 29, all other settings are left as default.
